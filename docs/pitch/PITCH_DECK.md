## Slide 4: How It Works
# Multi-Layer Protection System

```
Transaction → Encryption → AI Detection → Fair Ordering → Execution
     ↓           ↓              ↓              ↓            ↓
   User      Threshold      Neural         VDF         Protected
  Submits    Encryption    Networks     Ordering       Trade
```

### Core Components:
1. **Threshold Encryption** - 67% validator consensus required
2. **Neural Detection** - LSTM + Transformer + GNN
3. **Fair Ordering** - Verifiable Delay Functions
4. **MEV Redistribution** - Returns value to users
