### **Version A: The Problem-Solver**
```
Subject: Thanks for connecting! Quick MEV insight for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for accepting my connection!

Just ran a quick analysis - [Company] users lost approximately $[X]M to MEV last quarter. The sandwich attacks on [specific pool/pair] were particularly brutal.

We've built something different at MEV Shield:
• 6 neural networks detecting attacks in 3ms
• 99.9% prevention rate
• 80% of saved value returned to users
• 2-week integration

Quick question: How are you currently approaching MEV protection?

Happy to share what we're learning from protecting $500M+ in transactions - no pitch, just love exchanging ideas with builders tackling hard problems.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Our AI just discovered a new attack pattern targeting [their token type] pools. Details at mevshield.ai/insights

### **Version B: The Data-Driven**
```
Subject: MEV data for [Company] + achieving 99.9% protection

Hi [Name],

Great to connect! Following [Company]'s impressive growth.

Thought you'd find this interesting:

📊 MEV Impact on [Company] (Last 30 days):
• Sandwich attacks: [X] incidents, $[Y]M lost
• Your users' average loss: [Z]% per trade
• Most vulnerable pool: [Pool name]

We solved this at MEV Shield using AI:
• Neural networks trained on 10M+ attacks
• Predictive defense (2-3 blocks ahead)
• Already protecting $500M+ monthly

Not selling - but if curious how we achieved 99.9% accuracy when others plateau at 60%, happy to share our approach.

What's your take on MEV - solvable at protocol level or needs external solutions?

## 🎯 **Specific Templates by Company (Updated)**

### **For Uniswap Team**
```
Hi Hayden,

Uniswap V4's hooks are revolutionary! 

What if V4 had native AI-powered MEV protection? We've built exactly that - 99.9% protection, hooks-compatible, 3ms latency.

Uniswap loses $50M+ monthly to MEV. We can prevent that.

Worth discussing?

Details at mevshield.ai/uniswap
```

### **For Curve Finance**
```
Hi Michael,

Your v2 pools are brilliant but vulnerable to sophisticated MEV.

Our AI detected $20M extracted from Curve stable pools last month - attacks traditional solutions miss.

MEV Shield: 99.9% protection without impacting pool efficiency.

Interested in a pilot for stable pools?

Learn more: mevshield.ai/curve
```

### **For Arbitrum**
```
Hi Steven,

Make Arbitrum the first L2 with native AI-powered MEV protection?

• 99.9% prevention rate
• 3ms latency (perfect for your throughput)
• Exclusive L2 partnership available

This could be Arbitrum's biggest differentiator.

15 minutes to discuss?

Subject: Preventing $50M monthly MEV loss at Uniswap with AI

Hi Hayden,

Quick stat: Uniswap users lose ~$50M monthly to sandwich attacks.

We've built MEV Shield - 99.9% protection using neural networks:
• 6 AI models detecting attacks in 3ms
• Already protected $500M+ in transactions
• 80% of MEV value returned to users

Our neural network just identified 3 new attack patterns targeting V3 pools.

Worth a 15-minute demo this week? I can show you exactly which pools are losing the most.

Subject: Curve's $20M annual MEV problem - solved with AI

Michael,

Your v2 pools are architecturally brilliant. But even they're losing ~$20M annually to sophisticated MEV.

We've solved this at the transaction level:
• 99.9% MEV prevention (not mitigation)
• 3ms latency (won't slow your pools)
• AI that learns from new attacks

Just saved another protocol $5M last month.

15 minutes to show you which pools are most vulnerable?
