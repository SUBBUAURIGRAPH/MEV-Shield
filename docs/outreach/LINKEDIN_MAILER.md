## üí¨ **Welcome Messages** (Send immediately after connection)

### **Version A: The Problem-Solver**
```
Subject: Thanks for connecting! Quick MEV insight for [Company]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for accepting my connection!

Just ran a quick analysis - [Company] users lost approximately $[X]M to MEV last quarter. The sandwich attacks on [specific pool/pair] were particularly brutal.

We've built something different at MEV Shield:
‚Ä¢ 6 neural networks detecting attacks in 3ms
‚Ä¢ 99.9% prevention rate
‚Ä¢ 80% of saved value returned to users
‚Ä¢ 2-week integration

Quick question: How are you currently approaching MEV protection?

Happy to share what we're learning from protecting $500M+ in transactions - no pitch, just love exchanging ideas with builders tackling hard problems.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Our AI just discovered a new attack pattern targeting [their token type] pools. Happy to share details if helpful.
```

### **Version B: The Data-Driven**
```
Subject: MEV data for [Company] + achieving 99.9% protection

Hi [Name],

Great to connect! Following [Company]'s impressive growth.

Thought you'd find this interesting:

üìä MEV Impact on [Company] (Last 30 days):
‚Ä¢ Sandwich attacks: [X] incidents, $[Y]M lost
‚Ä¢ Your users' average loss: [Z]% per trade
‚Ä¢ Most vulnerable pool: [Pool name]

We solved this at MEV Shield using AI:
‚Ä¢ Neural networks trained on 10M+ attacks
‚Ä¢ Predictive defense (2-3 blocks ahead)
‚Ä¢ Already protecting $500M+ monthly

Not selling - but if curious how we achieved 99.9% accuracy when others plateau at 60%, happy to share our approach.

What's your take on MEV - solvable at protocol level or needs external solutions?

[Your name]
```

### **Version C: The Straight Shooter**
```
Subject: Save [Company] users $[X]M annually with AI

[Name],

Thanks for connecting! I'll be brief.

MEV Shield = 99.9% MEV prevention using neural networks.

For [Company]:
‚Ä¢ Save users ~$[X]M annually
‚Ä¢ 40% fewer complaints
‚Ä¢ 25% potential volume increase

Worth a 15-minute demo? No slides, just live protection in action.

If not interested, no worries - happy to share MEV insights regardless.

[Your name]

P.S. 30-day free pilot available for innovative protocols like yours.

Subject: This week's MEV attacks on [Company] + prevention tips

Hi [Name],

Quick update on MEV activity affecting [Company]:

This week:
‚Ä¢ New attack pattern: [Specific pattern]
‚Ä¢ Biggest loss: $[X] in block [number]
‚Ä¢ Vulnerable pool: [Pool name]

We prevented similar attacks using our neural networks - AI spots patterns humans miss.

Would weekly MEV reports for [Company] be helpful?

No agenda - just helping protocols protect users.

```

### **The Case Study**
```
Subject: How [Similar DEX] saved $5M in 30 days

[Name],

Thought this might interest you:

Just completed a pilot with [Similar DEX]:
‚Ä¢ 99.9% attacks blocked
‚Ä¢ $5M saved in first month
‚Ä¢ 25% volume increase

[Company] could see similar results - estimated $[X]M annual savings.

Want the full case study?

## üéØ **Specific Templates by Company**

### **For Uniswap Team**
```
Hi Hayden,

Uniswap V4's hooks are revolutionary! 

What if V4 had native AI-powered MEV protection? We've built exactly that - 99.9% protection, hooks-compatible, 3ms latency.

Uniswap loses $50M+ monthly to MEV. We can prevent that.

Worth discussing?
```

### **For Curve Finance**
```
Hi Michael,

Your v2 pools are brilliant but vulnerable to sophisticated MEV.

Our AI detected $20M extracted from Curve stable pools last month - attacks traditional solutions miss.

MEV Shield: 99.9% protection without impacting pool efficiency.

Interested in a pilot for stable pools?
```

### **For Arbitrum**
```
Hi Steven,

Make Arbitrum the first L2 with native AI-powered MEV protection?

‚Ä¢ 99.9% prevention rate
‚Ä¢ 3ms latency (perfect for your throughput)
‚Ä¢ Exclusive L2 partnership available

This could be Arbitrum's biggest differentiator.

15 minutes to discuss?
```

### **For PancakeSwap**
```
Hi Chef Team,

BSC's speed makes MEV worse - PancakeSwap users lose $1M daily.

MEV Shield offers:
‚Ä¢ First AI protection for BSC
‚Ä¢ 99.9% accuracy
‚Ä¢ 2-week integration

Be the first BSC DEX with neural network protection?
```

### **For Polygon**
```
Hi Sandeep,

Polygon's scale needs enterprise-grade MEV protection.

We're preventing 99.9% of attacks using AI - perfect for your throughput needs.

Exclusive partnership opportunity for Polygon.

Let's discuss?
